The project aims to implement a [sliding puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle) game, accessed through a web browser.<br/>

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Install pip
```bash
python -m pip
```

- Install and create a virtual environment
```bash
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv venv
```

- Install other requirements inside the virtual environment

## About 
‚úîÔ∏è This is a version of the well known Slider-Puzzle, with 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 variants. It has been developed for educational purposes to observe and map   problem solving patterns in human beings.

‚úîÔ∏è The app also includes an A* search solver for 3x3 puzzles that can autosolve any given configuration in optimum number of moves using a heuristic approach.

‚úîÔ∏è Coming Soon : 
      ‚ö° Algorithmic Solvers for other sizes. 
      ‚ö° Using Neural Nets for these puzzles.
